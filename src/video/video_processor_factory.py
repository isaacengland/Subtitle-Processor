Video Processor Factory - Format Selection and Management

This file implements the factory pattern for creating and managing video format
processors. It serves as the central registry for all supported video formats
and automatically selects the appropriate processor for any given file.

ARCHITECTURE ROLE:
This is the processor management layer that sits between the universal interface
and the format-specific implementations. It handles processor registration,
selection, and lifecycle management without exposing complexity to higher layers.

DESIGN PATTERN:
Implements the Factory Method pattern, providing an interface for creating
processor objects without specifying their exact classes. Also serves as a
Registry pattern, maintaining a central database of available processors.

SYSTEM INTEGRATION:
- Used by: UniversalVideoProcessor for format selection
- Manages: All format-specific processor instances (MKVProcessor, MP4Processor, etc.)
- Coordinates: Processor registration and retrieval

EXTENSIBILITY STRATEGY:
Adding new video format support is incredibly simple:
1. Create a new processor class implementing VideoProcessorBase
2. Register it in _register_default_processors()
3. That's it! The entire system automatically supports the new format

KEY BENEFITS:
1. **Centralized Management**: Single place to register all format processors
2. **Automatic Selection**: Picks the right processor based on file extension
3. **Zero Configuration**: New processors are automatically discovered
4. **Loose Coupling**: Higher-level code doesn't know about specific processors
5. **Easy Testing**: Can register mock processors for testing

    Processor Factory and Registry
    
    This class manages the creation, registration, and selection of video format
    processors. It acts as a central registry where all supported formats are
    registered and provides methods to automatically select the appropriate
    processor for any given file.
    
    FACTORY RESPONSIBILITIES:
    1. **Processor Registration**: Maintain a registry of all available processors
    2. **Format Mapping**: Map file extensions to appropriate processors
    3. **Processor Selection**: Choose the right processor for a given file
    4. **Capability Reporting**: Report what formats are supported
    
    REGISTRY PATTERN:
    The factory maintains an internal registry (dictionary) that maps file
    extensions to processor instances. This allows for O(1) lookup time
    and easy management of processor lifecycles.
    
    EXTENSIBILITY DESIGN:
    New processors are added by simply:
    1. Implementing the VideoProcessorBase interface
    2. Calling register_processor() with an instance

        EXTENSIBILITY:
        This is the main place where new format support is added to the

        REGISTRATION PROCESS:
        1. Get list of extensions supported by the processor
        2. For each extension, map it to this processor instance

        PROCESSOR LIFECYCLE:
        Processors are registered as instances, not classes. This means:
